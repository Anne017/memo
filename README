Usage
=====
On your desktop, open the terminal and type (from the app folder):

qmlscene app/main.qml

Building
========
This application uses CMake in order to build a Click package for Ubuntu devices.
To provide translations and grab some information from the development branch, some other tools are used.
Usually they are not installed with Ubuntu SDK.

If you are trying to compile an armhf Click package with Qt Creator/Ubuntu SDK, install the following packages in your "Ubuntu SDK kit" (Tools >> Options... >> [choose your armhf kit] >> Maintain):

apt-get install intltool bzr

If you target the Desktop kit, you may need another package:

sudo apt-get install qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-keyboard-extensions0.1
